# Squad IRL

> A community-driven collection of real-world automation samples built with Squad agent teams. Non-technical people design them. AI builds them. Anyone can learn from them.

## What Is This?

Tired of automation being hard? Squad makes it simple. This repo contains 19 working samples showing how Squad agent teams solve everyday problems — no coding required.

Each sample is a **self-contained TypeScript project** with a team of AI agents. All you do is describe your problem in plain English, and Squad builds the code. No API keys. No boilerplate. Real algorithms, real patterns, real problems solved.

**Example:** Want to optimize your weekly meal prep based on grocery sales? Tell Squad your idea. It analyzes your grocery data, suggests recipes, plans your meals, calculates savings. Done.

```bash
# Pick any sample, install, and run
cd social-media-manager
npm install
npm start
```

| [bug-triage](bug-triage/) | Turns GitHub issue backlogs into prioritized, deduplicated action plans with severity classification and triage recommendations |
| [compliance-checker](compliance-checker/) | Scans project folders to evaluate compliance across security, licensing, documentation, and privacy with traffic-light scoring |
| [contract-reviewer](contract-reviewer/) | Extracts contract clauses, scores risk, suggests negotiation alternatives, and delivers an executive summary with red flags |

## Why These Matter

Each sample demonstrates something real:

- **ab-test-orchestrator**: Statistical confidence in A/B decisions (not guessing)
- **inventory-manager**: Stock optimization that actually prevents stockouts
- **real-estate-analyzer**: Property ROI modeling with full financial math
- **contract-reviewer**: Red flags in legal language before you sign
- **gmail**: Email that doesn't steal your time
- **price-monitor**: "Buy now or wait?" decisions based on data
- **travel-planner**: Multi-city routing that minimizes backtracking

Every sample uses **real algorithms**. Not templates. Not toy code. The math that actually works.

## Getting Started

### Pick a Sample

Browse the samples above. Pick one that solves a problem you care about.

### Run It

```bash
cd YOUR-SAMPLE
npm install
npm start
```

That's it. No configuration. No API keys. Sample data included.

### Learn From It

Read the code. See how agents collaborate. Notice the patterns:

- Some samples **pipeline** — each agent refines the work of the previous one
- Some **fan out** — agents work in parallel and results combine
- Some **iterate** — agents keep improving until a quality threshold is met

## Contribute Your Own Sample

Have an idea? You don't need to be a coder. Tell Squad your idea, and it builds the sample for you.

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full workflow. The short version:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b squad/your-idea`
3. Tell Squad your idea: `copilot squad`
4. Squad builds the sample and updates the docs
5. Test it: `npm install && npm start`
6. Open a PR

**Your idea goes from concept to working sample in one session.**

The best ideas:
- Automate something you do weekly or daily
- Show multiple agents collaborating (not just one)
- Are relatable to normal people (not just engineers)
- Use a pattern we haven't covered yet

Examples: meal-prep planning, household budget optimization, job application tracking, travel itinerary building, receipt categorization.

## Built With Squad

This repo uses Squad for its own development. When you contribute a sample, you're using the same Squad that maintains this project. Community, Squad team, and AI collaborate as peers.
